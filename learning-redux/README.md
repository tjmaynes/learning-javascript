# voting-redux

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tjmaynes/voting-redux.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tjmaynes/voting-redux)

The code in this repository is based on this [tutorial](http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html). In this tutorial repo, I learned how to create and write unit tests for pure React components (no internal state) and how to connect action events to remote responses. Also, I learned alot about Redux, the predictable state container, which stores the state of your JS application over time.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Run server
npm run start-server

# Run client
npm run start-client
```
